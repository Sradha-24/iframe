        <p>Fruits are the means by which flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) disseminate 
            their seeds.Edible fruits in particular have long propagated using the movements of humans 
            and animals in a symbiotic relationship that is the means for seed dispersal for the one 
            group and nutrition for the other; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent 
            on fruits as a source of food </p>
